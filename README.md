Advanced Software Development 41026 project consisting of 3 releases.

# Release 0
Release 0 involves a DevOps pipeline with communication channels and a simple
CI/CD pipeline.

The GitHub repository was linked to our slack server. This was configured by:
1. Adding the Github application to slack
2. Running the command `/github subscribe TimOwe/asd-acme` (Slack application must have relevant permissions on GitHub)

This allows the server to notify members of updates on the repository.
